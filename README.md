# Angular-2-rc1-framework

* install node package manager   (http://blog.npmjs.org/post/85484771375/how-to-install-npm)

* run the ```npm install``` command in root dir so that package.json can download the necessary dependencies for the server side
* run the ```npm install``` command in /client dir so that package.json can download the necessary dependencies for the client side

* in root dir run ```node app.js``` or ```npm start``` and voila! you have a ui framework that is made with angular 2 rc1

This will launch the application at localhost:3000.
